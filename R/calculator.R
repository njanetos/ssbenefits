#' Computes social security benefits as a function of an individual's history
#' of earnings, retirement age, year in which they retired, and disability /
#' household status.
#'
#' @param ss_policy A list containing parameters for social security policy. See
#' 'Details'.
#' @param individual_profile A list containing the information about the
#' individual for whom social security benefits will be computed.
#' @return Vector of monthly social security benefit earnings, per year in
#' \code{current_year}.
#' @details The policy parameters consist of a wage index, so-called 'bend
#' points', retirement bonuses for retiring late, as well as cost-of-living
#' increases. The current values for these policies may be found on the social
#' security website, https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/Benefits.html. The
#' `ss_policy` list must contain the following items:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{\code{wage_index}: }{Wage indices used to inflate past earnings.
#'   (See here: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWIgrowth.html.)}
#'   \item{\code{bend_points}: }{So-called 'bend points'.
#'   (See here: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/bendpoints.html.)}
#'   \item{\code{pia_percentages}: }{Discounts applied to benefits depending on
#'   age of retirement.}
#'   \item{\code{cola_increases}: }{Annual cost of living increases applied to
#'   benefits.}
#' }
#' For formatting these inputs, see the data \code{ss_policy_defaults}, which
#' returns default values in the correct format, using current social security
#' administration policy as a guide. Load it with
#' \code{data(ss_policy_defaults)}.
